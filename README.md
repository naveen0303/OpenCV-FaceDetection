[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d7a7eb2ddc7a46d288f0559d34f0223a)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/naveenchalawadi/OpenCV-FaceDetection?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=naveen0303/OpenCV-FaceDetection&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Face Detection using C++ (OpenCV)

Test1.cpp contains the code for executing all the programs that are mentioned below. uncomment the code that we want to use and leave the remaining two codes commented. 

Compile and run Test1.cpp in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. Set Initial input argument as testimg.jpg.

Add External libraries - OpenCV and enable OpenMP support when compiling Q2 and Q3.

Q1. Serial Implementation of Face Detection Algorithm - 1serial.cpp

Q2. Parallel Implementation of Face Detection ALgorithm - 2parallel.cpp

Q3. Parallel Implementation using dynamic threading - 3parallel.cpp

Note: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 is free to download. In addition to that, install OpenCV in your system.
